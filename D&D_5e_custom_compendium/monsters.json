Yet despite their immense hardships, the fire ashari have given selﬂessly to the people of Tal’Dorei. Led by a half-orc ashari named Lorkathar, a group of firetamers keep watch over the volatile Scar of the Cinder King on the outskirts of Emon.",

A firetamer of Pyrah is nothing like the manic pyromancers of Tal’Dorei; while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire’s destructive power—or to use that same power to destroy those who threaten their people. Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a salamander, a fire elemental, or a small herd of magma or smoke mephits. While home in Pyrah, ashari firetamers use their power to control the Rift of Flame or to control the ﬂames of the Cindergrove."
